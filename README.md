# Poppin Soda Backend Overview

Welcome to the backend portion of the Poppin Soda website! For this backend code, I used Node and Express to create all my routes.  I used Jest to test if my routes responded to any hits on them.  I also used Swagger API to create the documentation for it.  Feel free to look at the code and the swagger documentation!

# Development Environment 

The environment I used for this project was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  The Web Page was deployed on GitHub.  This project used Node JS, Express JS, and JavaScript.  I also  used Swagger to create my API documentation.  I deployed my backend on Render and my database on MongoDB. These services worked well for this project.
